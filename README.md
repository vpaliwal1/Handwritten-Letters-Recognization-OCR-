To run files you need to use Jupyter Notebook.

1.Training.ipynb : This is a jupyter notebook file, in which we train some models and the architecture with the result evaluation of test images.

2.Test_new_images.ipynb: This jupyter notebook file is to predict some new images, that we took from camera and we use our top trained models for predicton.
Use the images present as test_images for testing with trained models.

3. Trained Models: The .h5 files consists of some our trained model, which we can use for prediction of new images. We can also check and visualize some of the testing images with these models.

4. Image_Acquisition_Webcam.py: This file can be used to take the images from webcam.
